## How does it work?
It uses pub data extracted from the Game History page. For every game, each player receives a rating, and this rating is used to determine the rankings.

## Rating System
Rating is done through OpenSkill. An algorithm designed for multiplayer, that will yield better results than a TPM Elo. You’re scored independently from your team based on what you bring to the table, and who you’re versus.

Whilst display names are tracked and ranked, they’re not shown on any leaderboard or profile. You will only see them on the recent games list.

## Why isn't my game showing up?
Each game runs through a checklist before it can be ranked. If a game fails to pass through the checklist successful it gets discarded and the game is not ranked. e.g. game must contain at least 4 players per team, with each player having played at least 30 seconds. Basically, the checklist is used to filter out uneven games and exploits.
